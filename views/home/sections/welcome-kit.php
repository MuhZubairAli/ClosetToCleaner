                    Soon after signing up, you will receive your welcome kit. Look for a small box with our big logo, open it up, and enjoy.

                    You will receive two service bags: <br>

                    <span style="color:rgb(19,25,54)">NAVY BLUE (since we mean business) for Wash and Fold Laundry</span> <br>

                    <span style="color:#015a54">TURQUOISE (because we’re fancy) for Dry Cleaning</span>
                    <br><br>
                    You will also receive a separate mailing with your personal barcode 1-2 business days after the kit. Place the barcodes in the clear pocket of the bags, and you are good to go!
